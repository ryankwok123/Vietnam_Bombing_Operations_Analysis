# Vietnam_Bombing_Operations_Analysis

FINAL PRODUCT: https://tabsoft.co/3I7t8BE 

Data analysis project using THOR data from the Vietnam war era. 

Bombing analysis conducted using SQL Server (queries here) and Tableau. Dataset was found in a Vietnam war era THOR Report (Theatre History of Operations) provided by
the United States Air Force. Source: https://data.world/datamil/vietnam-war-thor-data 

I did the analysis for this project mainly using SQL. There is one Python script (not written by me) included in the folder of this repo; all credit to Jie Jenn (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Ry3CBXXW0) 

Since I was using Tableau Public I was unable to connect the visualization software directly to SQL server.
As a result I ended up having to create views to save as xlsx or txt files which would then be uploaded to Tableau Public. 

Please check the (very messy) log file included to see the general workflow behind this project. Thanks for visiting!
